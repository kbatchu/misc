1) Make the CDC logo a link to the CDC home page.
2) Add ‘Alt text’ to the CDC logo image.
3) Add aria-labels to the 'maximize' buttons
4) Make the parent div (class="widget") of the widget focusable by adding 'tabindex=0". Update 'aria-label' of this div dynamically through javascript with the content text e.g. Global Cases are 194,129, updated on 03/12/2020
5) Make the 'expand' button of the widget 'fa-expand-arrows-alt'. Make the 'reset' button 'fa-compress'. I did not find the corresponding 'fa-compress-arrows-alt' in this version.
6) Make the border of the widget boxes light gray. The black lines are too distracting.
7) For div id="divHeader_image", remove alt text="Title image" to "CDC Coronavirus Interactive".
8) Add aria-label to the 'select' element for US Cases dropdown.
9) Change alt text of CDC logo image to 'CDC Home Page'.
10) Add role="alert" aria-label="Loading" to img id="loading".
11) Add Skip link for skipping navigation menus.
12) Change the 'title' of the page to a more appropriate description. Remove the word 'Prototype'
13) The img in div id="divHeader_image' should have more descriptive 'alt' text e.g. CDC Coronavirus Interactive, Explore maps,charts and data

2.4 NAVIGABLE
-------------
2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (A) 
- Add 'Skip Link' on top of page that goes directly to the main content area. https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html

2.4.2 Page Title (A)
- Change the 'title' of the page. Should adequately and briefly describe the content of the page. Also remove the word 'Prototype'. https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html

2.4.3 Focus Order (A) https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html
- Make the div id="divHeader_image" focusable by adding tabindex="0". Add 'aria-label' with some text e.g. 'Explore maps, charts and data of Coronavirus - 19 from CDC'. Keep 'alt' text for the img inside this div.
- Focus should first be set on <div id="widget_3">. Add aria-label="Cases by Country table" or other meaningful description. All data tables should be structured to be made 'accessible'. Read: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/. More exhaustive example with code: https://inclusive-components.design/data-tables/
- Focus should first be set on <div id="widget_4">. Add aria-label with a meaningful description.
- Trap Focus - When a widget is maximized, the focus should shift to first focusable element inside the maximized widget. The focus should keep rotating through the focusable elements within the maximized widget, until it is minimized again. When the widget is minimized, the focus should be set back to the element which triggered the maximization of the widget, i.e. the 'maximize' button.
This logic applies to 'modal' dialogs as well.

2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (A)
- Change the aria-label for div id="navButtons" to 'Primary' instead of 'main'.
- Add aria-label to the 'maximize' buttons.

2.4.5 Multiple Ways (AA)
- No issues found

2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA)
- Generate meaningful aria-label text for div id="widget_1" through Javascript for e.g. Global cases are 832,623 as of 03/24/2019.
  Add aria-hidden="true" to div id="globalconf". Do this for the other similar Global and USA widgets.

2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA)
- Make the focus indicator highly visible when an element gets the focus. https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html
